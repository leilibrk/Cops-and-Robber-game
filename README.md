# Cops-and-Robber-game
This is my first project in Fundamentals of Computer Programming. It's a cops and robber game. 
First the program asks the number of rows and columns for the map of the game. Then it asks the number of the polic stations and the number of the cops in each station.
Then the game starts and the robber moves randomly.
when a police see the robber (the robber should be near him), he will call other police from the same station and they will try to catch the robber by moving to the same place in the map.
when the cops catch the robber, the game ends.
