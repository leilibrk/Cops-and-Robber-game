# Cops-and-Robber-game
This is my first project in Fundamentals of Computer Programming. It's a cops and robber game. 
First the program asks the number o f rows and columns for the map of the game. Then it asks the number of the polic stations and the number of the cops in each station.
Then the game starts and ends when all the robbers are catched by the cops.
